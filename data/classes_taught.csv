NRES 800," Sampling, Data Management and Visualization",University of Nebraska-Lincoln,Fall,"This graduate course is designed to introduce students to implement best practices for scientific computing. Practice with a scientific workflow from the design of the sampling scheme, through generation of the data in the field or lab, up to the point of analysis. Understand cognitive constraints on visualization. Use modern software tools to analyze and produce publication quality data visualizations.",16,19,24,20,,23,24,20,
NRES 315,Human Dimensions of Fisheries and Wildlife Management,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,Fall,"This undergraduate course is designed to introduce students with the basic concepts and ideas relevant in human dimension of natural resource management. This course is divided into three sections. The first section focuses on the
foundation of human dimensions by introducing the student to the theories that underlie the field.
The second section focuses on the methodological approaches in human dimensions research
including survey design and analysis. The third section will focus on applications of human
dimensions research into consumptive and non-consumptive aspects of fish and wildlife
management, with attention to how the field continues to develop.",7,11,36,46,57,62,75,73,
NRES 323,Natural Resource Policy,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,Spring,"This course is designed for undergraduate students in a variety of majors, including
natural resources, natural resource and environmental economics, and environmental studies. Students from other disciplines who have an interest in environmental and natural resource policy are also encouraged to take this course. As the human population, resource consumption, and land use pressure increase, the policies for management and protection become more important and more challenging. This course will introduce students to the political processes, participants, and programs involved in formatting natural resource policy in the United States.",,,,47,56,52,53,43,67
NRES 898,Special Topics: How Did They Do That? A Graduate Seminar In Data Analytics Using R,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,Spring,"This course will provide students with
the skills to understand and adapt analytic techniques presented in peer-reviewed literature to their research. The course will focus on use of the R statistical language in applications relevant
to ecology, biology, fisheries and wildlife, grasslands, forests, aquatic habitats, and human
dimensions of natural resources. The topics covered are student driven. Emphasis will be placedon developing conceptual and practical understanding of how to apply statistical techniques withreal-world data, checking assumptions, exploratory data analysis, presentation of results, and developing sound coding skills. A working knowledge (e.g., ability to read data in to R, data manipulation, graphing) of R is required.",,,,14,,,11,7,
NRES 898,Computational Human Dimensions,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,Spring,"Computational Social Science (CSS) is an interdisciplinary field that combines techniques from computer science, social science, and statistics to analyze social phenomena using large-scale data. Computational Human Dimensions uses processes and techniques in CSS to analyze human behavior in an environmental and conservation context.  This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts, methods, and tools in computational social science. Students will gain hands-on experience in collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing social data, and will learn how to apply computational techniques to address social science research questions. The course will cover various topics such as social network analysis, text mining, machine learning, and simulation modeling",,,,,,,,,7
